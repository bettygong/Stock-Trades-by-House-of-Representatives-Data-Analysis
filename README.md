# Stock-Trades-by-House-of-Representatives-Data-Analysis
This is a course project for [DSC80](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html) at UCSD.\
In this report, I conduct data analysis on Stock Trade executed by members of US House of Representatives. The report covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data missingness analysis, and hypothesis inference in the report. Through the hypothesis test, the report addressed questions such as whether party representatives hold different transaction style, and what the most popular companies Representatives like to invest in are answered. \
The final report can be found [Stock_Analysis_final_report](Stock_Analysis_final_report.ipynb)
