## Data Analysis
In this report, I conduct data analysis on Stock Trade executed by US House of Representatives members. The report covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data missingness analysis, and hypothesis inference. Through the hypothesis test, the report addressed questions such as whether party representatives hold different transaction style, and what the most popular companies Representatives like to invest in are answered. \
